## Description

The **ERP** module provides Laraplate’s **accounting and operations** domain: multi-company, chart of accounts, journal entries, fiscal calendar, tax codes, commercial scaffolding (customers, quotations, projects), and related Filament admin resources. The module is **optional** and can be enabled or disabled via `modules_statuses.json` like other Laraplate modules.

The package evolves with product requirements; treat public APIs as unstable until a stable release is declared.

## Installation

If you want to add this module to your project, you can use the `joshbrw/laravel-module-installer` package.

In a full Laraplate application you typically depend on **Core** first, then add **ERP**. Add the repositories to your `composer.json` file (adjust URLs if you use forks or private registries):

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-core.git"
    },
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-erp.git"
    }
]
```

```bash
composer require joshbrw/laravel-module-installer swolley/laraplate-core swolley/laraplate-erp
```

Then install and activate the modules:

```bash
php artisan module:install Core
php artisan module:install ERP
```

Ensure `modules_statuses.json` lists `ERP` as enabled when you want the module loaded.

## Configuration

When the module is active, configuration is published under the **`erp`** key (file: `Modules/ERP/config/config.php`).

```php
// Example
config('erp.name'); // "ERP"
```

Per-company ERP settings are stored in `companies.settings` (JSON). Use `ErpCompanySettings` to read dotted keys (e.g. `erp.three_way_match.price_tolerance_percent`). The `config/erp.php` file only exposes module metadata.

-   Separate document numbering (SalesCreditNote, PurchaseCreditNote, SalesDebitNote, PurchaseDebitNote)
-   `CreditNoteService` (create CN from posted invoice, line copying, total validation)
-   Inverted journal entries on credit note posting

### M6.1 — Bank Reconciliation

-   `BankAccount`, `BankStatement`, and `BankStatementLine` models
-   Bank statement import from CSV, CAMT.053, and a minimal MT940 transaction subset
-   Manual reconciliation service with ranked payment suggestions
-   Match-with-difference service and Filament workflow for fees, rounding, and write-offs

-   `BankStatementLine.difference_journal_entry_id` keeps audit linkage to the accounting adjustment

### M6.2 — Returns Management

-   `ReturnOrder` for customer returns and `SupplierReturn` for supplier returns
-   Customer returns generate/link inbound DDTs for physical stock receipts
-   Supplier returns generate/link outbound DDTs for physical stock shipments
-   DDT lines remain quantity/source-link only; no prices or costs on bolle
-   Return completion tracks returned quantities on source invoice / sales order / purchase order / goods receipt lines
-   Manual follow-up actions create and link credit/debit note drafts; optional setting `erp.returns.auto_create_notes_on_complete` creates NC/ND drafts during return completion
-   Customer return credit notes use `ReturnOrderLine.invoice_line_id` and the source sales `InvoiceLine.unit_price`; `ReturnOrderLine.unit_price` is an optional manual override.
-   Supplier return debit notes use `SupplierReturnLine.invoice_line_id` and the source purchase `InvoiceLine.unit_price`; `purchase_order_line_id` and `goods_receipt_line_id` remain logistics references.
-   Supplier return debit-note creation is blocked when the source purchase invoice line is missing. Returning goods physically can happen from PO/GR, but fiscal correction must reference the purchase invoice.

### M7.1 — Advanced Pricelists & Party Rules

-   `PriceList` / `PriceListItem` with validity windows and Filament resource
-   `PartyPriceRule` with percent, fixed, and override discounts
-   `Party::price_rules()` relation and Party Filament relation manager
-   `PriceResolverService` and `InvoiceLinePricingService` apply commercial pricing to quotation / sales order / invoice lines
-   `Activity` is the concrete ERP taxonomy used for activity-based price rules; do not point UI directly at abstract Core `Taxonomy`.

### Spec 2 Phase 2A/2B — Domain Actions & Commercial UX

-   State-aware `ERPModelPolicy` guards domain actions on top of Core CRUD permissions.
-   Domain abilities seeded in `ERPDatabaseSeeder` include posting/unposting, forced posting, e-invoice submit/refresh, quotation unlock, and document-sequence reset.
-   Filament edit/list actions call services; they do not implement business mutations inline.
-   Implemented Phase 2B items: Party price rules UI, PriceList resource, quotation unlock, document sequence reset, return line fiscal override contract, and optional auto NC/ND on return complete.
-   Implemented Phase 2B items also include supplier payment runs with SEPA `pain.001` export.
-   Implemented Phase 2B banking items also include bank difference journals, match-with-difference UI, and CAMT.053 / MT940 statement import.
-   Implemented Phase 2B reporting items also include CSV export actions for trial balance, balance sheet, and income statement.
-   Implemented Phase 2B operational dashboard items also include Sales Pipeline filters/KPIs/CSV export and Stock Valuation warehouse filter/KPIs/CSV export.

### Supplier Payment Runs

-   Supplier bank coordinates live on `PartyBankAccount`, not on invoices or payment lines.
-   `PaymentRunBuilderService` selects open/partial purchase invoice schedule lines and creates a draft payment run.
-   `PaymentRunLine` stores a beneficiary snapshot: name, IBAN, BIC, amount, due date, and remittance text.
-   Payment runs move through `draft -> approved -> exported`; `cancelled` is available before export.
-   Exported payment runs are immutable and store file name, export timestamp, and SHA-256 checksum.
-   The first supported bank format is SEPA Credit Transfer `pain.001`; bank submission and Italian/proprietary formats remain backlog.

### Filament Admin UI

-   **Resources:** Party, Contact, Quotation, Project, Lead, Opportunity, SalesOrder, DeliveryNote, Invoice, PurchaseOrder, GoodsReceipt, ReturnOrder, SupplierReturn, PaymentTerm, Payment, PaymentRun, BankAccount, BankStatement, VatRegister (read-only), VatSettlement (read-only)
-   **Core accounting:** Company, Account, JournalEntry (with view page), FiscalYear, FiscalPeriod, DocumentSequence, TaxCode
-   **Report pages:** Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Sales Pipeline, Stock Valuation. Financial and operational report pages expose CSV export actions.

-   Phase 3+: domain HTTP actions, API exposure governance, reverse processed returns, and later accounting architecture improvements

## Scripts

The ERP module exposes the same Composer script conventions as **Cms** and **Core**:

### Code quality and testing

```bash
composer test                 # Full test and quality pipeline
composer test:standalone      # Unit-focused Pest run
composer test:type-coverage   # Type coverage (target: 100%)
composer test:typos           # Peck typo check
composer test:lint            # Pint + Rector dry-run
composer test:types           # PHPStan
composer test:refactor        # Rector
```

### Maintenance

```bash
composer lint                 # Rector, Pint, IDE helpers
composer check                # PHPStan
composer fix                  # PHPStan with fix
composer refactor             # Rector
composer update:requirements  # composer bump + npm-check-updates
```

### Versioning

```bash
composer version:major
composer version:minor
composer version:patch
```

### Hooks

```bash
composer setup:hooks
```

## Repository rename (from laraplate-business)

If you still have a clone using the old remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:swolley/laraplate-erp.git
# or HTTPS: https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-erp.git
```

In the parent Laraplate app, update `.gitmodules` to `path = Modules/ERP` and `url` / `pushurl` for `laraplate-erp`, then run `git submodule sync` and `composer update`.
