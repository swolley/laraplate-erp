## Description

The **ERP** module provides Laraplate’s **accounting and operations** domain: multi-company, chart of accounts, journal entries, fiscal calendar, tax codes, commercial scaffolding (customers, quotations, projects), and related Filament admin resources. The module is **optional** and can be enabled or disabled via `modules_statuses.json` like other Laraplate modules.

The package evolves with product requirements; treat public APIs as unstable until a stable release is declared.

## Installation

If you want to add this module to your project, you can use the `joshbrw/laravel-module-installer` package.

In a full Laraplate application you typically depend on **Core** first, then add **ERP**. Add the repositories to your `composer.json` file (adjust URLs if you use forks or private registries):

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-core.git"
    },
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-erp.git"
    }
]
```

```bash
composer require joshbrw/laravel-module-installer swolley/laraplate-core swolley/laraplate-erp
```

Then install and activate the modules:

```bash
php artisan module:install Core
php artisan module:install ERP
```

Ensure `modules_statuses.json` lists `ERP` as enabled when you want the module loaded.

## Configuration

When the module is active, configuration is published under the **`erp`** key (file: `Modules/ERP/config/config.php`).

```php
// Example
config('erp.name'); // "ERP"
```

Per-company ERP settings are stored in `companies.settings` (JSON). Use `ErpCompanySettings` to read dotted keys (e.g. `erp.three_way_match.price_tolerance_percent`). The `config/erp.php` file only exposes module metadata.

## Scripts

The ERP module exposes the same Composer script conventions as **Cms** and **Core**:

### Code quality and testing

```bash
composer test                 # Full test and quality pipeline
composer test:standalone      # Unit-focused Pest run
composer test:type-coverage   # Type coverage (target: 100%)
composer test:typos           # Peck typo check
composer test:lint            # Pint + Rector dry-run
composer test:types           # PHPStan
composer test:refactor        # Rector
```

### Maintenance

```bash
composer lint                 # Rector, Pint, IDE helpers
composer check                # PHPStan
composer fix                  # PHPStan with fix
composer refactor             # Rector
composer update:requirements  # composer bump + npm-check-updates
```

### Versioning

```bash
composer version:major
composer version:minor
composer version:patch
```

### Hooks

```bash
composer setup:hooks
```

## Repository rename (from laraplate-business)

If you still have a clone using the old remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:swolley/laraplate-erp.git
# or HTTPS: https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-erp.git
```

In the parent Laraplate app, update `.gitmodules` to `path = Modules/ERP` and `url` / `pushurl` for `laraplate-erp`, then run `git submodule sync` and `composer update`.
